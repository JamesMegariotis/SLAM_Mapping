1.) Get structure from motion in real time
    -Sparse reconstruction is easily generate, but how do we put known dimensions or give the reconstruction some sort of scale.
    -What dimesions are necessary?
        ~distance from camera POV to points in the reconstruction (2-3 points for triangulation)
    -Verify Camera Pose Estimation relaive to world frame
        ~SFM gives orientation/pose estimation from each image capture
            +compare quaternion output to known camera orientation at time of image capture
            +use gem to aquire quaternion at moment of image capture and compare to camera data from SFM
    -Aquire and incorporate GPS data to give map a location in real world frame
        ~May help to give a scale to the map. Distances can be extrapolated from GPS readings
2.) Optimize feature detection for real time use
    -Computation time increases exponentially with the number of photos being analyzed
    -Process images in a given minimum number of images (Possibly pairs or in groups of 4-10 images)
3.) Dense reconstruction in real time for visualization/Demonstration
    -May be considerable lag in rendering the Point Cloud Model
    -Possibly register and stitch smaller point cloud models in real time to avoid computationally expensive operations
    -How to piece together smaller point clouds and store them as 3D grid components containing all relevant data such as coordinates and surface normals
4.) Send Usable map to other vehicle in order to allow for localization based on feature matching
    -Possibly add to map and increase accuracy as navigating
